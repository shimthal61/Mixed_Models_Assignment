Question 1
In a repeated measures experiment participants had to respond to a word that appeared in one of three
contexts. These were “Neutral”, “Negative”, and “Positive”. There were 24 participants and 24 items. Each
item appeared in each of the three contexts. By building the appropriate mixed model, determine whether
context influenced response time on the dependent variable (labelled “DV” and measured in milliseconds).

Question 2
In a 2 x 2 repeated measures experiment, participants had to respond to a face that depicted either “Anger”
or “Fear”. Each face was presented after a Story Vignette that described either an angry or fearful situation. There were 32 participants and 32 vignettes. By building the appropriate mixed model, determine
whether the fixed factors of “StoryEmotion” and “FaceExpression” influenced response time on the dependent variable (RT) which was measured in milliseconds. The data for this question can be found in the file
“assignment1_data2.csv”
